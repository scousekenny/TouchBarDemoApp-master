## Installation

Ensure you have installed [macOS Sierra 10.12.1 build 16B2657](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1897), which adds support for the Touch Bar to macOS. **Build 16B2555 does not have Touch Bar support, so it won't work**.

Just fetch the latest ZIP from the [release section](https://github.com/bikkelbroeders/TouchBarDemoApp/releases) section and put the extracted app into your Applications folder.

To build the iOS app, open `TouchBar.xcodeproj`, connect your iOS device and select the TouchBarClient target and your device:
